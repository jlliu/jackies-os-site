When you hit a Thing, edit it in <b>My Sketchbook</b> or check out related Spaces.</p>\n            <h2 id=\"anchor-sketchbook\">My Sketchbook</h2>\n            <p><b>My Sketchbook</b> is a testament to the main passion of 10-year-old Jackie: drawing (especially on the computer). Drawing is something she was always told was \"just a hobby\", whereas engineering and math were more viable career options. More than a notepad app, and also more than a paint application, the sketchbook is the central mode of creation in Jackie's OS - one that values the narrativization of her own experiences and emotions.</p>\n\n            <h4>How to use</h4>\n            <p>Browse through drawings, diary entries, and scrapbook images, in My Sketchbook. Click the \"Edit\" button to draw, write, or add emotional sticker tags to anything you create.</p>\n            <h2 id=\"anchor-explorer\">Cloud Explorer</h2>\n            <p>The <b>Cloud Explorer</b> is the web browser on Jackie's OS, featuring the website she would have liked to have for herself when she was younger (if she only knew how to put one up....) The <b>Cloud Explorer</b> features a built in editor for her own website - responding to a wish that barriers to engaging with technology could have been lower for her past self, as a 10 year old girl in the mid 2000s.</p>\n            <h4>How to use</h4>\n            <p>Explore Jackie's website through jackies.world, make edits to the site, and check out her favorite sites to go on as a child.</p>\n            <h2 id=\"anchor-messages\">Postcards</h2>\n            <p><b>Postcards</b> are a way to send messages in Jackie's OS, not only with friends, but also between herself - past and future. <b>Postcards</b> is encouragement for Jackie to introspect and have conversations with different version of herself - just as the design and creation of Jackie's OS is a conversation between her 2020 and 2006 selves.</p>\n            <h3>Timeteller</h3>\n            <p>\n              What time is it?
